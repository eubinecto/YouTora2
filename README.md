# YouTora
Search Youtube videos like you search books.

## youtora.learn

For university students.
- index all lectures uploaded on YouTube, and make it searchable by captions
- Take screenshots at the start time of all tracks, and index them too
Using a text detection model available online
- add text_cnt to each track
- add text_area_rel_img to each track
- implement a visual - textual filter, for ranking the results
  - visual: show the videos with less text first : likely to be engaging, easy to understand
  - textual: show the videos with more text first: likely to be boring and academic, but informative
## youtora.idioms

For my 3rd-year project.

- build an audiovisual groundings of idioms.
- idiom2video: can we generate a video given an idiom?
not sure if I can do this, but this will be fun!
- also, language-independent sentiment analysis of videos
- Recognising emotions doesn't necessarily require language acquisition
the tone of the speech & facial expression is enough
## youtora.fun

Just for fun! YouTube is a gold mine of audio-visual dataset. Make it easy to access this huge
multimodal data, and make fun out of it!
